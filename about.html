<p>
Hello, I'm Avery Mizrahi. I'm a sophomore at Harvard College studying neuroscience on the Mind, Brain, Behavior track. More than anything, I am interested in the overlap between the human mind and the biological brain, and moreover how we can use this overlap when curing disease. When I'm not in the lab or running my conference (see below), this semester I am working towards a half marathon and working on my secondary in Comparative Literature!
