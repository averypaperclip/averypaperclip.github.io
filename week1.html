    When I first began in neuroscience, I was very interested in the idea of memory, specifically how it degenerates in Alzheimer's Disease. 
    That interest has never gone away. I was first an NSF Fellow studying biomarkers for Alzheimer's at 
    <a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/myassa/">the Yassa Lab</a>, 
    and most recently I studied decision-making at 
    <a href="https://hamilos.wi.mit.edu/">MIT's Hamilos Lab</a>. 
    All of this drove me to ask the question: how can we best interface with the brain to 
    1) understand memory and 2) treat neurodegenerative disease?
  </p>

  <p>
    With this goal in mind, I began as an intern at 
    <a href="https://niatherapeutics.com/">Nia Therapeutics</a>, 
    a brain–computer interface (BCI) company developing a therapeutic for memory loss. 
    Now, in PHYSCI70, I want to ask a related question: how can I build a simplified design 
    that gives us a glimpse into the brain?
  </p>

  <p>
    One major inspiration for this project was the 
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/feb/03/vegetative-state-patient-communication">
      House–Tennis Test
    </a>, 
    in which a patient in a vegetative state can communicate by answering questions through 
    imagining either a house or playing tennis. Because these tasks activate different parts 
    of the brain, the interviewer can infer a yes or no response.
  </p>

  <p>
    My idea is to use an accessible EEG to read brain waves. First, the interviewer asks a question 
    (such as “Do you like ice cream?”). If the answer is yes, the user is asked to solve a math problem, 
    producing beta waves associated with focus. If the answer is no, the user relaxes, producing alpha 
    waves associated with rest. These signals would trigger a small circuit that moves a dial to indicate 
    “Yes” or “No.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I recognize that this is an ambitious project. Alternative ideas along the same theme include a 
    device that visualizes memory decay through fading LEDs, or a lamp that responds to heart rate as 
    a speculative indicator of emotional state.
