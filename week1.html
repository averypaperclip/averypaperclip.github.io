    When I first began in neuroscience, I was very interested in the idea of memory, specifically how it degenerates in Alzheimer's Disease. 
    That interest has never gone away, I first was a NSF-Fellow studying biomarkers for Alzheimer's <a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/myassa/">
    and most recently I studied decision-making at MIT's Hamilos Lab <a href="https://hamilos.wi.mit.edu/">. All this drove me to ask the question, 
    how can we best interface with the brain to best 1) understand memory and 2) cure neurodegenerative disease?
  </p>

  <p>
    A lofty goal, I began as an intern at Nia Therapeutics <a href="https://niatherapeutics.com/">: a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) company developing
    a therapeutic for memory loss. Now, in PHYSCI70, I want to ask the question: how can I build a simplistic design that gives us a look into the brain?
    My inspiration for this project was the House-Tennis Test <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/feb/03/vegetative-state-patient-communication">, 
    where a patient in a vegetative state can communicate by answering questions through either thinking of a house or playing tennis - because these activate different 
    parts of the brain, the interviewer can get a yes or no answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    My idea is to use some sort of accessible EEG to read brain waves. Then: 1) the interviewer will ask a question (such as, do you like ice cream?). 
    2) The user will either be asked to solve a math problem if the answer is yes (Beta waves indicate focus and will be read by the EEG), or relax if the 
    answer is no (Alpha waves indicate relaxation and will be read by the EEG). 3) This will then trigger a small circuit where a dial points to "Yes" or "No"
    depending on the user's brain wave characterization. I know this is a big project to accomplish! My alternative ideas around the same topic include either a 
    device to record memories and the LEDs fade overtime on memories you do not practice, OR a lamp that response to heartrate to hypothetically show someone's mood.
