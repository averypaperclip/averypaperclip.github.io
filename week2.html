  <h2>Background</h2>
  
  <p>
    At the beginning of this week, I had never once touched Fusion 360. I knew of CAD, but didn't grasp the mechanics. I definetely felt the learning curve, struggling at first with the

    My inspiration for choosing this object has to do with a possibility for my final project, making headphones that play gamma waves. This was hard because of all the organic shapes,
    but I felt I was able to get into some semblance of a flow state (especially with the help of this <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wto1a9ncJtk">tutorial</a>).
