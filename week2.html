  <h1>Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting</h1>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  
  <p>
    When I first began studying neuroscience, I was very interested in the idea of memory, and specifically how it degenerates in Alzheimer's Disease. 
    That interest has never gone away. First, I was a NSF-Fellow studying biomarkers for Alzheimer's 
    <a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/myassa/">at the Yassa Lab</a>
    and most recently I studied decision-making at 
    <a href="https://hamilos.wi.mit.edu/">MIT's Hamilos Lab</a>. 
    All this drove me to ask the question, 
    how can we best interface with the brain to best 1) understand memory and 2) cure neurodegenerative disease?
